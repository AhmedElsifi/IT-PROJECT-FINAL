\section*{Loan Payment Formula}

The monthly payment \( M \) for a loan is calculated using the annuity formula:

\[
M = \frac{P \cdot r \cdot (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

\subsection*{Where:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( M \): Monthly payment (the amount to be paid each month)
  \item \( P \): Principal amount (loan amount) = Price of item $-$ Down payment
  \item \( r \): Monthly interest rate = \(\frac{\text{Annual Interest Rate}}{12 \times 100}\)
  \item \( n \): Total number of payments = Loan term in years \( \times \) 12
\end{itemize}
